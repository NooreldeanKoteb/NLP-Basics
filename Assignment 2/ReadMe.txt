This code assumes that nltk, scipy, re, numpy, and matplotlib are installed/downloaded properly.

I have included the processed folder with all the words used in this program. 
However if you decide to use other words the wiki-news-300d-1M-subword.vec file should be in the 
same folder as the source code and the glove.txt files should be in a folder named "glove".
analogy.txt, reuters.test.txt, and reuters.train.txt should be in the same folder as the code.

to run the program navigate to the folder containing 'nkoteb-hw2-code.py' and run this command:

> py nkoteb-hw2-code.py

The program will pop out a graph for the last part of the assignment close it to continue.
The program should create a file named analogy-predictions.txt before ending.
